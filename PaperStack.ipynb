        "#@markdown PaperStack is a **multi-agent AI pipeline** for **automated document generation**.\n",
        "#@markdown It demonstrates how specialized AI agents can work together to produce **structured, domain-specific writing**—whether for research papers, technical reports, or other formal documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "#@markdown This notebook is an **experiment in automation**, not an attempt to generate human-quality academic work.\n",
        "#@markdown Instead, it provides a **transparent and modular** way to observe and tweak how AI systems compose structured content step by step.\n",
        "#@markdown Since all outputs are fully AI-generated, they are **not attributable to any person or entity**.\n",

        "#@markdown Once the user inputs a topic, the AI pipeline progresses through a structured sequence of tasks to produce, refine, and format the document.\n",

        "#@markdown PaperStack operates through a structured multi-agent process, ensuring systematic content generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#@markdown **Task-Specific System Prompts**\n",
        "#@markdown - Each AI agent is assigned a specialized role, receiving structured prompts tailored to its function within the pipeline. These task-specific instructions ensure focused execution at each stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "#@markdown **Strict Formatting Guidelines for Outputs (JSON)**\n",

        "\n",
        "#@markdown **Dual-Layer JSON Validation**\n",
        "#@markdown - Generated JSON responses undergo **automated validation** to check for structural and syntactical correctness. If JSON parsing fails, the result is passed to a **LLM JSON fixing agent** to correct errors. This loop repeats until parsing is successul and the result is passed to the next agent in the pipeline.\n",

        "#@markdown **Drafting and Paragraph-Level Revisions**\n",

        "\n",
        "#@markdown **Section Scanning and Coherence Revisions**\n",
        "#@markdown - After paragraph-level refinements, each section is analyzed for **coherence** and **repetition**. A separate AI agent provides targeted revision instructions for each to ensure logical consistency and reduce redundancy across the document.\n",

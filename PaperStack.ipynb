        "#@markdown PaperStack is a **multi-agent AI pipeline** for **automated document generation**.\n",
        "#@markdown It demonstrates how specialized AI agents can work together to produce **structured, domain-specific writing**—whether for research papers, technical reports, or other formal documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "#@markdown This notebook is an **experiment in automation**, not an attempt to generate human-quality academic work.\n",
        "#@markdown Instead, it provides a **transparent and modular** way to observe and tweak how AI systems compose structured content step by step.\n",
        "#@markdown Since all outputs are fully AI-generated, they are **not attributable to any person or entity**.\n",

        "#@markdown **Dual-Layer JSON Validation**\n",
        "#@markdown - Generated JSON responses undergo **automated validation** to check for structural and syntactical correctness. If JSON parsing fails, the result is passed to a **LLM JSON fixing agent** to correct errors. This loop repeats until parsing is successul and the result is passed to the next agent in the pipeline.\n",
